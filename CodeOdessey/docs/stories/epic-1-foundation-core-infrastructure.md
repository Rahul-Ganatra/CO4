# Story: Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Status:** Ready for Review  
**Epic Goal:** Establish the foundational project infrastructure including authentication, core visual storyboard builder, and offline functionality to deliver the primary differentiator of the platform. This epic creates the essential building blocks that enable users to begin creating business plans through an intuitive, visual interface while ensuring the system works seamlessly offline.
