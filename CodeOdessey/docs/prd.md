# The Unfair Advantage Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Transform raw business ideas into structured, compelling business cases through visual storyboards
- Provide immediate, foundational guidance to aspiring entrepreneurs without mentor dependency
- Enable offline-first functionality for rural entrepreneurs with limited internet access
- Deliver real-time AI-powered feedback that builds confidence through strengths-first evaluation
- Create scalable mentor tools that focus on strategic coaching rather than repetitive evaluation
- Democratize access to high-quality business analysis across language and literacy barriers
- Establish a learning AI system that improves from mentor feedback over time

### Background Context

The Unfair Advantage addresses a critical bottleneck in India's entrepreneurship development ecosystem. Currently, thousands of aspiring entrepreneurs from rural and semi-urban areas struggle to transform their brilliant, raw ideas into structured business plans due to limited access to consistent, high-quality feedback. The existing system relies heavily on one-on-one mentorship, creating scalability constraints where mentors spend 80% of their time on repetitive, low-value evaluation tasks instead of strategic coaching.

This solution leverages AI and visual design to create an inclusive platform that works offline, supports multiple languages, and provides immediate feedback through gamified storyboard interfaces. By combining accessibility-first design with intelligent evaluation capabilities, the platform levels the playing field for rural entrepreneurs while enabling mentors to focus on high-potential cases, ultimately scaling the impact of entrepreneurship development programs across India.
