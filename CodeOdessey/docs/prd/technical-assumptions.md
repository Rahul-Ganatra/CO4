# Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

The project will use a monorepo structure with separate frontend and backend services, enabling shared code, consistent tooling, and simplified deployment for the hackathon timeline.

### Service Architecture

**Hybrid Architecture:** The system will use a microservices approach within a monorepo, with separate services for:
- Frontend (Next.js PWA)
- Backend API (Node.js/Express)
- AI/LLM Integration Service
- File Processing Service (images, audio)
- Sync Service (offline/online data management)

This architecture balances scalability with development speed for the hackathon constraint.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing:** The system will implement unit testing for core business logic and integration testing for API endpoints and database operations. Given the 24-hour timeline, end-to-end testing will be limited to critical user journeys only.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 14 with TypeScript for type safety and development efficiency
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and responsive design
- **State Management:** Zustand for lightweight, simple state management
- **Database:** MongoDB for flexible document storage of business plans and user data
- **Caching:** Redis for session management and temporary data storage
- **Cloud Platform:** Google Cloud Platform leveraging $300 free credits
- **AI Services:** Google Cloud AI Platform for LLM integration, Vision API for image processing
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for user sessions
- **File Storage:** Local storage for offline functionality, GCP Cloud Storage for sync
- **Real-time Communication:** Socket.io for live feedback and updates
- **Deployment:** Vercel for frontend, GCP for backend services
- **Offline Storage:** IndexedDB for local data persistence and offline functionality
