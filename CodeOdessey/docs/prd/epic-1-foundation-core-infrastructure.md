### Story 1.3: Offline-First Data Storage

As a rural entrepreneur with limited internet access,
I want my business plan data to be stored locally on my device,
so that I can work on my ideas even without internet connectivity.

2. Business plan data persists when user refreshes page
3. System works completely offline after initial load
4. Data sync indicator shows when offline/online status
5. Local storage handles at least 50MB of data
6. Data is encrypted for privacy and security
7. Graceful degradation when storage limits are reached

### Story 1.4: Basic Authentication and User Management

I want to create an account and securely access my business plans,
so that my work is protected and I can access it from different devices.
