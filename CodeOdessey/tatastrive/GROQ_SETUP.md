## What's Been Implemented

### ðŸ¦ˆ Shark Tank-Style Evaluation Criteria

The system now evaluates business plans using **9 key criteria** that Shark Tank judges would consider:

1. **Uniqueness (0-100)**: How unique and innovative is this idea?
2. **Feasibility (0-100)**: How realistic is it to execute this business?
3. **Market Potential (0-100)**: How large is the addressable market?
4. **Scalability (0-100)**: Can this business grow significantly?
5. **Team Execution (0-100)**: How well can the team execute based on plan quality?
6. **Financial Viability (0-100)**: Is the revenue model realistic?
7. **Innovation (0-100)**: How innovative is the approach?
8. **Competitive Advantage (0-100)**: What makes this better than existing solutions?
9. **Risk Assessment (0-100)**: How well have risks been identified and addressed?
